        My phone number +375(25)786-83-99(mts)</br>
        I am thirty and I am married, I have a little daughter and I want her to be
        happy and healthy, this is the most important thing for me.</br>
        I know a little html, css and js.</br>
        I have a little work experience so far.</br>
        I finished front end development courses and read some tutorials on this
        topic.</br>
        I studied English at school, but since then I periodically read
        books in English so as not to lose knowledge and develop it a little.</br>
